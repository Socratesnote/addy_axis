# addy_axis

A new take on plotting data across multiple y-axes in MATLAB. Creates a pair of visible/invisible axes: the invisible one is used to overlay data with the existing main axes, while the visible one is placed adjacent to the main axes to indicate the scale.
Maintains zoom, pan, and data cursor functionality.

For usage, see addy_demo.m.
